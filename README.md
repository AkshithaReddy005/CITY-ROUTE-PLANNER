City Route Planner
A Java-based application designed to manage and optimize a city's road network by finding the shortest paths between intersections and detecting cycles within the graph. This project combines practical problem-solving with graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and Depth First Search (DFS).

Features
Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient route between two intersections.
Cycle Detection: Detects cycles in the graph to identify redundant connections or potential issues in the road network.
Interactive Menu: Provides a user-friendly console interface for dynamically adding intersections and roads and running queries.
Tech Stack
Language: Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth First Search (DFS)
Data Structures: HashMap, Priority Queue, List
